# Drag-and-Drop Feature Implementation

## Project Overview

This project implements a drag-and-drop UI feature using React and React Flow. The feature allows users to interactively drag cards, resize them, and view detailed information through a modal popup. The project demonstrates the integration of various components such as `ResizableBox`, `React Flow nodes`, and custom styling to create an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.
